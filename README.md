# Img2Cartoon

CartoonGAN, is used by CartoonGAN school of cartooning. 
It USES pictures of real objects as source images to create cartoons of any style, 
such as makoto shinkai or hayao miyazaki.
Some people say that this is not just a filter of Photoshop, 
of course Photoshop can do it, but only give you a minute to produce hundreds of images, 
Photoshop can do it?

The effect of the model called by the author is very good, the effect diagram is as follows.

The author did not open the source code, but only provided four trained models (miyazaki hayao, hosoda, kamin and shinkai styles). The author used Pytorch for the experiment.
